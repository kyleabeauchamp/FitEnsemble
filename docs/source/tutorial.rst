Accessing the fit_ensemble Tutorials
====================================

The fit_ensemble tutorials take the form of a set of IPython notebooks.  
To view these notebooks, you have two options.  

First, you can view them on the web.  Viewing on the web allows you to see the results
of a completed tutorial, but does *not* allow you to perform the calculations yourself.  
The tutorials are available here:

* Tutorial1_
* Tutorial2_
* Tutorial3_
* Tutorial4_

Alternatively, you can use IPython to interactively complete the tutorials.  
This requires you to have successfully installed `fit_ensemble`.  After installation,
go to the `tutorials` directory in the `fit_ensemble` directory.  Then type::

	ipython notebook --pylab=inline

A web browser should open to the IPython Notebook manager.  Four tutorials should be listed.  You 
should complete the tutorials in order, as each tutorial extends the previous ones.

Accessing the FitEnsemble Tutorials
====================================

The FitEnsemble tutorials take the form of a set of IPython notebooks.  
To view these notebooks, you have two options.  

First, you can view them on the web.  Viewing on the web allows you to see the results
of a completed tutorial, but does *not* allow you to perform the calculations yourself.  
The tutorials are available here:

* Tutorial1_
* Tutorial2_
* Tutorial3_
* Tutorial4_
* Tutorial5_

Alternatively, you can use IPython to interactively complete the tutorials.  
This requires you to have successfully installed `FitEnsemble`.  After installation,
go to the `tutorial` directory in the `FitEnsemble` directory.  Then type::

	ipython notebook --pylab=inline

A web browser should open to the IPython Notebook manager.  Five tutorials should be listed.  You 
should complete the tutorials in order, as each tutorial extends the previous ones.
